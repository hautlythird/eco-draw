## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |

| Save Project | `Ctrl+S` |
| Open Projects | `Ctrl+O` |

## What Gets Saved?

When you save a project, everything is preserved:
- ✅ All drawn lines and strokes
- ✅ Shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles)
- ✅ Placed images and plants
- ✅ Text elements
- ✅ Layer structure
- ✅ Element positions and properties

## Storage Information

- Projects are stored in your browser's localStorage
- Typical limit: 5-10MB (enough for many projects)
- Projects are device-specific (not synced across browsers)
- Clearing browser data will delete saved projects
- Maximum 50 projects (oldest removed automatically if exceeded)

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't save project"**
- Your browser storage might be full
- Try deleting old projects you don't need
- Export important projects first

**"Project not loading"**
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check browser console for errors

**"Lost my projects"**
- Check if browser data was cleared
- Look for downloaded JSON backup files
- Import them using the Import button

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Export important projects monthly
2. **Organize**: Delete old test projects to free space
3. **Name Clearly**: Use dates or descriptions in names
4. **Test Loads**: Occasionally load old projects to verify they work
5. **Multiple Versions**: Duplicate before major changes
